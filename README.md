# Budget Tracker

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information.

This challenge required us to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.
